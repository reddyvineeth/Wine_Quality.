# Wine_Quality.
This is a classification technique used to predict the quality of wine based on several variables like 'Fixed_acidity', 'Volatile acidity', 'Citric acid', 'Residual_sugar', 'Chlorides' , 'Free sulfur dioxide',  'density', 'PH' and 'Alcohol'.
Here I have used various classification techniques like Logistic Regression, Random forest classifier, KNeighbours classifier, Svm and apply GridSearchCV to improve the accuracy of the model and see which ML Algorithm is performing well and giving the best accuracy score.
Random Forest Classifier worked out well and gave accuracy of 81.7% with a 500 estimators.
